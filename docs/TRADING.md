### Deployment Instructions

#### Prerequisites

1. A Vercel account for hosting the dashboard
2. Node.js 16+ installed for local development
3. Proper environment configuration

#### Dashboard Deployment Steps

1. **Prepare Environment Variables**:
   Make sure the following variables are configured in both your bot's `.env` file and the dashboard's environment:

   ```
   # CosmoVision Bot Variables
   API_SECRET_KEY=your_secure_api_key
   DASHBOARD_URL=https://your-dashboard-url.vercel.app
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_signing_secret

   # Dashboard Variables (in Vercel)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-bot-api-url.vercel.app
   ```

2. **Deploy the Dashboard to Vercel**:

   ```bash
   cd dashboard
   npm run build
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. **Set Up CORS**:
   Ensure the `tradingDashboard.js` API endpoint has proper CORS headers configured for your dashboard domain.

4. **Test Authentication Flow**:
   - Use the `/dashboard` command in the bot
   - Copy the one-time code
   - Visit the dashboard and enter the code
   - Verify successful login and data fetching

## Security Considerations

The dashboard implements several security measures:

1. **One-time codes**: Short-lived (5 minutes) and single-use
2. **JWT Authentication**: Securely signed tokens with a 7-day expiration
3. **API Secret Key**: Protected API endpoints
4. **CORS Protection**: API access limited to the dashboard domain

## Data Integration

The dashboard integrates with the bot's existing data model:

1. **Trading Signals**: Generated by the bot and stored in the database
2. **User Trades**: Managed through both the bot and dashboard
3. **Performance Metrics**: Calculated based on trade history
4. **User Settings**: Synced between bot and dashboard

## Technical Architecture

The trading system consists of:

1. **TradingService**: Core logic for signal generation and trade management
2. **TradeModel**: Database interface for storing and retrieving trade data
3. **Dashboard**: Next.js front-end with Tailwind CSS styling
4. **API Endpoint**: Integration between the dashboard and bot
